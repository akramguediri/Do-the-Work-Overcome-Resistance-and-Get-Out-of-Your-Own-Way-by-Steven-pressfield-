{"book_name":"Do the Work, Overcome Resistance and Get Out of Your Own Way by Steven Pressfield","genre":"self-help","chapter_id":5,"chapter_title":"THREE-ACT STRUCTURE","summary":"In this chapter, Pressfield emphasizes the importance of starting before you feel ready and taking action against Resistance. He argues that preparation can often lead to procrastination, so it’s crucial to dive straight into the work with boldness and courage. He introduces a creative diet—limiting research to three books to avoid overthinking. Pressfield urges creatives to embrace the chaotic nature of creation and to aim for big ideas rather than small, incremental ones. A practical approach to storytelling is presented through the three-act structure, encouraging artists to quickly outline their projects to maintain momentum and clarity.","visual_theme":{"prompt":"The archetypal hero poised in chaos, an atmospheric surreal environment with tension, high-contrast and unnatural lighting, dark and disruptive color palette, emotionally charged mood, avant-garde art style, a visceral textured feel, unsettling composition, hyper-detailed symbolic texture, close-up lens for tension --v 7 --style raw --chaos 30 integration","style":"Dynamic and bold","overlay_opacity":70,"blur_strength":5,"color_palette":["#D2BBA0","#3B3A3F","#1D1D1D"],"font_primary":"GapSansBold.ttf","font_secondary":"CooperHewitt-Book.otf","text_color":"#D2BBA0","text_shadow":true,"alignment":"center","safe_margin_percent":10,"image_size":"--ar 2:3"},"slides":[{"id":1,"section_title":"BEGINNING WITH BRAVERY","section_body":"The moment we wait to feel ready is the moment we allow Resistance to take control.
